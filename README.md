# Hotel-Bookings-Analysis

Here's what the hotels can do to improve business in the future:

    1.Resort hotels tend to have less bookings in comparison to city hotels so they need to work on their marketing strategy and promote the hotels more, especially on social media.
    2.Resort hotels could also reduce prices to increases booking percentages.
    3.Although city hotels have more bookings, they also tend to have more cancellations so to prevent this they could take advance money during vacation. This would ensure most bookings to not being cancelled. 
    4.They could also apply no-refund policies or make the refund policies rather strict so the customers choose not to cancel.
    5.It is quite clear most customers travel in pairs and bringing children or babies along are very rare so the hotels could advertise in ways that attract couples more and also business travellers.
    6.Most guests do not return but as these customers have already visited once, advertisements should be targeted in such ways so they are bound to return the next time they visit. The customers could also be offered          special benefits if they do return to stay.
